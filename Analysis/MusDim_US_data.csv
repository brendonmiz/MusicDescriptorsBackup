Consent Form

 

This study involves a web-based experiment designed to investigate how people assign descriptors to different styles of music. The study is being conducted by Brendon Mizener, W. Jay Dowling and Herve Abdi of The University of Texas at Dallas, and Mathilde Vandenberghe, of the Yncréa institute of Lille, France, and it has been designated by The University of Texas at Dallas Office of Research Integrity and Outreach as exempt from review by an Institutional Review Board. No deception is involved, and the study involves no more than minimal risk to participants (i.e., the level of risk encountered in daily life). 

 

Participation in the study typically takes 30 minutes and is strictly confidential. This survey is best performed on a computer using headphones, but a mobile device will also work. Participants will listen to a selection of 15 short (approximately 30-40 seconds) novel music excerpts and evaluate them using descriptors (adjectives) or how they rate on various musical dimensions. At the end, we will collect some anonymous demographic information and some information about your level of musical experience and your occupation. All of the information we collect will be anonymous and will be used only for scientific purposes. 

 

All responses are treated as confidential, and in no case will responses from individual participants be identified. Rather, all data will be pooled and published in aggregate form only. Participants should be aware; however, that the experiment is not being run from a ""secure"" https server of the kind typically used to handle credit card transactions, so there is a small possibility that responses could be viewed by unauthorized third parties (e.g., computer hackers). 

Many individuals find participation in this study enjoyable, and no adverse reactions have been reported thus far. Participants enrolled in the UTD school of Brain & Behavioral sciences and are eligible will receive SONA credit for participation. Participants who are not enrolled in the UTD School of Brain & Behavioral Sciences will not be compensated for participation.

 

Participation is voluntary, refusal to take part in the study involves no penalty or loss of benefits to which participants are otherwise entitled, and participants may withdraw from the study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which they are otherwise entitled. 

 

If participants have further questions about this study, they may contact the Principal Investigator, Brendon Mizener at (972) 883-2059 or bmizener@utdallas.edu, Dr. W. Jay Dowling at (972) 883-2059 or jdowling@utdallas.edu, and Dr. Hervé Abdi at (972) 883-2065 or herve@utdallas.edu; Participants who want more information about their rights as a participant or who want to report a research related concern may contact The University of Texas at Dallas Office of Research Integrity and Outreach at (972) 883-4579.
