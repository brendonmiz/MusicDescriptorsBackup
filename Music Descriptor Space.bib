abstract = {We investigated whether the perception of the crispness and staleness of potato chips can be affected by modifying the sounds produced during the biting action. Participants in our study bit into potato chips with their front teeth while rating either their crispness or freshness using a computer-based visual analog scale. The results demonstrate that the perception of both the crispness and staleness was systematically altered by varying the loudness and/or frequency composition of the auditory feedback elicited during the biting action. The potato chips were perceived as being both crisper and fresher when either the overall sound level was increased, or when just the high frequency sounds (in the range of 2 kHz-20 kHz) were selectively amplified. These results highlight the significant role that auditory cues can play in modulating the perception and evaluation of foodstuffs (despite the fact that consumers are often unaware of the influence of such auditory cues). The paradigm reported here also provides a novel empiric methodology for assessing such multisensory contributions to food perception. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2004, Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract = {Musical behaviours are universal across human populations and, at the same time, highly diverse in their structures, roles and cultural interpretations. Although laboratory studies of isolated listeners and music-makers have yielded important insights into sensorimotor and cognitive skills and their neural underpinnings, they have revealed little about the broader significance of music for individuals, peer groups and communities. This reviewpresents a sampling of musical forms and coordinated musical activity across cultures, with the aim of highlighting key similarities and differences. The focus is on scholarly and everyday ideas about music-what it is and where it originates-as well the antiquity of music and the contribution of musical behaviour to ritual activity, social organization, caregiving and group cohesion. Synchronous arousal, action synchrony and imitative behaviours are among the means by which music facilitates social bonding. The commonalities and differences in musical forms and functions across cultures suggest new directions for ethnomusicology, music cognition and neuroscience, and a pivot away from the predominant scientific focus on instrumental music in the Western European tradition.},

Students exiting a music program should have a broader basis for choosing music and perhaps an ability to enjoy more different styles of music than before they started. Research investigating factors that influence musical preference is reviewed. Factors include tempo, familiarity, teacher influence, peer influence, and modeling. Teachers should take the music preference of the students into consideration when designing lessons, choosing music, and delivering instruction. Knowledge of music preference and the factors that influence it are indispensable to music educators in discovering the appropriate rewards for their students: music that brings enjoyment to the student.},

abstract = {One of the most important steps of new product development process is product optimization, which aims at identifying consumers' ideal products and directions for product reformulation. The present work proposes the application of a penalty analysis based on consumer responses to CATA questions to identify drivers of liking and directions for product reformulation. Two studies were conducted in which 74 and 119 consumers evaluated a set of samples (5 apples and 8 yogurts) using a check-all-that-apply question related to sensory characteristics and were also asked to check all the terms they considered appropriate to describe their ideal product. Data were analyzed by counting the number of consumers who did not check an attribute as they did for their ideal product, and its associated mean drop. A dummy variable transformation approach was proposed to make linear regression models between CATA terms and overall liking scores using Partial Least Squares (PLS). Juiciness, sweetness, apple flavor, firmness and crispiness were the most relevant attributes for consumers in the apple study. Meanwhile, in the yogurt study smoothness, homogeneity and creaminess were the main drivers of liking and were responsible for the highest penalization on overall liking (more than 1 in the 9-point hedonic scale). PLS regression enabled the identification of the attributes which deviation from the ideal caused a significant decrease in overall liking. Penalty analysis on CATA questions proved to be a simple and useful approach to identify drivers of liking and directions for improving the products in both studies. Advantages and disadvantages of this approach are discussed, as well as directions for further research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The so called “musical mood induction procedure” (MMIP) relies on music to produce changes in experienced affective processes. The fact that music can have this effect on subjective experience has been utilized to study the effect of mood on cognitive processes and behavior by a large number of researchers in social, clinical, and personality psychology. This extensive body of literature, while little known among music psychologists, is likely to further help music psychologists understand affective responses to music. With this in mind, the present article aims at providing an extensive review of the methodology behind a number of studies using the MMIP. The effectiveness of music as a mood-inducing stimulus is discussed in terms of self-reports, physiological, and behavioral indices. The discussion focuses on how findings from the MMIP literature may extend into current research and debate on the complex interplay of music and emotional responses.},

Individual experience may have entered into a student's judgment, but it probably did so to confirm the original stereotype which he had learned. Because human beings from time to time exhibit all kinds of behavior he could find confirmation of his views. By omitting cases which contradict the stereotype, the individual becomes convinced from association with a race that its members are just the kind of people he always thought they were. The manner in which public and private attitudes are bound up together was shown in the order of the 10 racial and national groups as determined by the definiteness with which students assigned characteristics to them. The definiteness of the stereotyped picture of a race, however, had little relation to the prejudice exhibited against that race.

For the purpose of determining their personality traits the participants completed the 16PF Questionnaire (Cattell, Saunders, {\&} Stice, 1957; Russel {\&} Karol, 1993), in its Polish adaptation by Choynowski (Nowakowska, 1970). The participants' musical preferences were determined by their completing a Questionnaire of Musical Preferences (specifically created for the purposes of this research), in which respondents indicated their favorite piece of music. Next, on the basis of the Questionnaire of Musical Preferences, a list of the works of music chosen by the participants was compiled. All pieces were collected on CDs and analyzed to separate out their basic musical elements. The statistical analysis shows that some personality traits: Liveliness (Factor F), Social Boldness (Factor H), Vigilance (Factor L), Openness to Change (Factor 01), Extraversion (a general factor) have an influence on preferences regarding musical elements. Important in the subjects' musical preferences were found to be those musical elements having stimulative value and the ability to regulate the need for stimulation. These are: tempo, rhythm in relation to metrical basis, number of melodic themes, sound voluminosity, and meter. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the American Music Therapy Association.},

abstract = {Our initial aim in this study was to show that Western listeners can sort the music of 3 Western composers consistently on the basis of their compositional style. We found that they could, and proceeded to investigate what cues they might be using to accomplish that task, as well as whether their use of those cues was related to their level of musical training. In Experiment 1, we presented 21 excerpts from the keyboard music of Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, each excerpt linked to an icon on the computer screen. Participants were to place the icons in different groups following the rule that the icons in one group could have been written by the same composer. First, they did a free sort in which they could form as many groups as they liked, and then we told them that there were just 3 composers, and they should make 3 groups in a constrained sort. In Experiment 1, the excerpts were produced with MIDI transcriptions of the scores, such that the composer's pitch and time information of the notes was preserved, but there was no variation in tempo, dynamics (loudness), or articulation (connectedness or separateness of notes in time). In spite of this simplification, listeners succeeded in clearly differentiating the composers in the constrained sort. In Experiment 2, we used more natural stimuli, 36 excerpts taken from recordings of the 3 composers by 4 pianists who had recorded substantial amounts of each: Arrau, Barenboim, Pir{\`{e}}s, and Richter. Here, the stimuli included all the expressive cues of a live performance, and in the constrained sort listeners were even better at categorizing the composers, with not very much difference between the categorizations of trained and untrained listeners. Their judgments were also strongly influenced by the pianists. Richter's performances of the 3 composers were clustered relatively close to the Mozart region of the solution, indicating their clarity and balance; in contrast, those of Barenboim were clustered in the Beethoven region, indicating their sumptuousness and passion. We used a relatively new approach to data analysis—DiSTATIS—which provided the possibility of projecting the sorting results viewed from various perspectives—composer, pianist, participant expertise—into the same space, giving a clearer picture of the results than a piecemeal account of those perspectives.},

These musical bursts were designed to be the musical analog of the Montreal Affective Voices (MAV)-a set of brief non-verbal affective vocalizations portraying different basic emotions. The MEB consist of short (mean duration: 1.6 s) improvisations on a given emotion or of imitations of a given MAV stimulus, played on a violin (10 stimuli × 4 [3 emotions + neutral]), or a clarinet (10 stimuli × 4 [3 emotions + neutral]). The MEB arguably represent a primitive form of music emotional expression, just like the MAV represent a primitive form of vocal, non-linguistic emotional expression. To create the MEB, stimuli were recorded from 10 violinists and 10 clarinetists, and then evaluated by 60 participants. Participants evaluated 240 stimuli [30 stimuli × 4 (3 emotions + neutral) × 2 instruments] by performing either a forced-choice emotion categorization task, a valence rating task or an arousal rating task (20 subjects per task); 40 MAVs were also used in the same session with similar task instructions. Recognition accuracy of emotional categories expressed by the MEB (n:80) was lower than for the MAVs but still very high with an average percent correct recognition score of 80.4{\%}. Highest recognition accuracies were obtained for happy clarinet (92.0{\%}) and fearful or sad violin (88.0{\%} each) MEB stimuli. The MEB can be used to compare the cerebral processing of emotional expressions in music and vocal communication, or used for testing affective perception in patients with communication problems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Paquette, Peretz and Belin.},

abstract = {WHEN DESIGNING A NEW STUDY REGARDING HOW music can portray and elicit emotion, one of the most crucial design decisions involves choosing the best stimuli. Every researcher must find musical samples that are able to capture an emotional state, are appropriate lengths, and have minimal potential for biasing participants. Researchers have often utilized musical excerpts that have previously been used by other scholars, but the appropriate musical choices depend on the specific goals of the study in question and will likely change among various research designs. The intention of this paper is to examine how musical stimuli have been selected in a sample of 306 research articles dating from 1928 through 2018. Analyses are presented regarding the designated emotions, how the stimuli were selected, the durations of the stimuli, whether the stimuli are excerpts from a longer work, and whether the passages have been used in studies about perceived or induced emotion. The results suggest that the literature relies on nine emotional terms, focuses more on perceived emotion than on induced emotion, and contains mostly short musical stimuli. I suggest that some of the inconclusive results from previous reviews may be due to the inconsistent use of emotion terms throughout the music community.},

abstract = {The important role of the valence and arousal dimensions in representing and recognizing affective qualities in music is well established. There is less evidence for the contribution of secondary dimensions such as potency, tension and energy. In particular, previous studies failed to find significant relations between computable musical features and affective dimensions other than valence and arousal. Here we present two experiments aiming at assessing how musical features, directly computable from complex audio excerpts, are related to secondary emotion dimensions. To this aim, we imposed some constraints on the musical features, namely modality and tempo, of the stimuli.The results show that although arousal and valence dominate for many musical features, it is possible to identify features, in particular Roughness, Loudness, and SpectralFlux, that are significantly related to the potency dimension. As far as we know, this is the first study that gained more insight into the affective potency in the music domain by using real music recordings and a computational approach.},

abstract = {One approach to improving sound quality is to create a preference map on the basis of several acoustic parameters relevant to auditory perception. The map is derived from several stages of subjective testing, acoustic analysis, and auditory modeling. The multidimensional scaling technique CLASCAL reveals common perceptual dimensions shared by sets of sounds samples, perceptual features specific to each sound, and the different subject classes among listeners. The listeners are asked to judge the degree of dissimilarity of all pairs of sounds on a continuous scale. The analysis gives a perceptual spatial representation of the sounds. From this analysis, acoustic and auditory modelling analyses can be performed to determine the stimulus parameters that are strongly correlated with different perceptual dimensions and, where possible, with the specific features. The next stage in the analysis involves determining the probability of one sound being preferred to another. An analysis of the data allows a projection of the structure of listeners' preferences onto the physical parameter space underlying the previously determined multidimensional perceptual space. In many cases, it is found that the physical parameters having the most effect on the listeners' preferences are dependent on the set of stimuli being compared. Furthermore, when one stimulus parameter is kept constant across trials, this may alter the effects of other parameters on the listeners' preferences. Therefore context effects must be taken into account in multidimensional sound quality analysis, particularly since the qualitative aspects of most sounds are clearly multidimensional.},

abstract = {COMPOSERS CONVEY EMOTION THROUGH MUSIC BY co-varying structural cues. Although the complex interplay provides a rich listening experience, this creates challenges for understanding the contributions of individual cues. Here we investigate how three specific cues (attack rate, mode, and pitch height) work together to convey emotion in Bach's Well Tempered-Clavier (WTC). In three experiments, we explore responses to (1) eight-measure excerpts and (2) musically ‘‘resolved'' excerpts, and (3) investigate the role of different standard dimensional scales of emotion. In each experiment, thirty nonmusician participants rated perceived emotion along scales of valence and intensity (Experiments 1 {\&} 2) or valence and arousal (Experiment 3) for 48 pieces in the WTC. Responses indicate listeners used attack rate, Mode, and pitch height to make judgements of valence, but only attack rate for intensity/arousal. Commonality analyses revealed mode predicted the most variance for valence ratings, followed by attack rate, with pitch height contributing minimally. In Experiment 2 mode increased in predictive power compared to Experiment 1. For Experiment 3, using ‘‘arousal'' instead of ‘‘intensity'' showed similar results to Experiment 1. We discuss how these results complement and extend previous findings of studies with tightly controlled stimuli, providing additional perspective on complex issues of interpersonal communication.},

The comparison between perceptual spaces suggested that timbre perception is unaffected by native language. Additionally, comparisons between semantic and perceptual spaces revealed sub- stantial similarities which suggest that verbal descriptions can convey a considerable amount ofperceptual informa- tion. The previouslydetermined semantic labels ‘‘auditory texture'' and ‘‘luminance'' featured the highest associa- tions with perceptual dimensions for both languages. ‘‘Auditory mass'' failed to show any strong correlations.

abstract = {Music's ability to express and arouse emotions is a mystery that has fascinated both experts and laymen at least since ancient Greece. The Handbook of Music and Emotion offers an up-to-date account of this vibrant domain. It provides comprehensive coverage of the many approaches that may be said to define the field of music and emotion, in all its breadth and depth. The first section offers multi-disciplinary perspectives on musical emotions from philosophy, musicology, psychology, neurobiology, anthropology, and sociology. The second section features methodologically-oriented chapters on the measurement of emotions via different channels (e.g., self report, psychophysiology, neuroimaging). Sections three and four address how emotion enters into different aspects of musical behavior, both the making of music and its consumption. Section five covers developmental, personality, and social factors. Section six describes the most important applications involving the relationship between music and emotion. In a final commentary, the editors comment on the history of the field, summarize the current state of affairs, as well as propose future directions for the field. The only book of its kind, the Handbook of Music and Emotion will fascinate music psychologists, musicologists, music educators, philosophers, and others with an interest in music and emotion (e.g., in marketing, health, engineering, film, and the game industry). It will be a valuable resource for established researchers in the field, a developmental aid for early-career researchers and postgraduate research students, and a compendium to assist students at various levels. In addition, as with its predecessor, it will also attract interest from practicing musicians and lay readers fascinated by music and emotion.

Subjects heard standard melodies followed by comparison melodies presented in the same key, a musically near key or a musically far key. The task was to recognize comparisons that were exact transpositions of the standards, rejecting nontranspositions. Results suggested a largely invariant key-distance effect with nontransposition comparisons (lures); same- and near-key lures evoked more false alarms than far-key lures. The variables of musical experience, age of subject, and familiarity of melody affected the level of transposition-recognition performance but did not consistently affect the size of the key-distance effect. The results support the psychological reality of key distance and are consistent with both musical and nonmusical-auditory theories of its effects. The key-distance effect was not found with transposition comparisons (targets), a result with implications for the separability of key and interval information in short-term memory for melodies.},

The stimuli were isolated instrument sounds and emotional speech prosody categorized by listeners into anger, happiness and sadness, respectively. We first analyzed the timbral features of the stimuli, which showed that relations between the three emotions were relatively consistent in those features for speech and music. The results further echo the size-code hypothesis in which different sound timbre indicates different body size projections. Then we conducted an ERP experiment using a priming paradigm with isolated instrument sounds as primes and emotional speech prosody as targets. The results showed that emotionally incongruent instrument-speech pairs triggered a larger N400 response than emotionally congruent pairs. Taken together, this is the first study to provide evidence that the timbre of simple and isolated musical instrument sounds can convey emotion in a way similar to emotional speech prosody.},

Changes of mode (r¯ agam) are particularly interesting in Carn¯ atic music because of the large number of modes (more than 300) in its tonal system. We first had musicians generate profiles to establish a baseline for each of four r¯ agams in isolation. Then we obtained dynamic profiles of two modulating excerpts, each of which incorporated two of the four baseline r¯ agams. The two excerpts used the two techniques of modulation in Carn¯ atic music: grahab¯ edham (analogous to a Western shift from C major to A minor), and r¯ agam¯ alik¯ a (anal-ogous to a shift from C major to C minor). We assessed listeners' tracking of the modulations by plotting the correlations of their response profiles with the baseline profiles. In general, the correlation to the original r¯ agam declined and the correlation to the new r¯ agam increased with the modulation, and then followed the reverse pattern when the original r¯ agam returned. Westerners' responses matched those of the Indians on r¯ agams with structures similar to Western scales, but differed when r¯ agams were less familiar, and surprisingly, they registered the shifts more strongly than Indian musicians. These findings converged with previous research in identifying three types of cues: 1) culture-specific cues-schematic and veridical knowledge-employed by Indians, 2) tone-distribution cues-duration and frequency of note occurrence-employed by both Indians and Westerners, and 3) transference of schematic knowledge of Western music by Western participants.},

A number of potential acoustic correlates of timbre-space dimensions have been proposed in the psychoacoustic literature, including attack time, spectral centroid, spectral flux, and spectrum fine structure. The experiments reported here were designed as direct tests of the perceptual relevance of these acoustical parameters for timbre dissimilarity judgments. Listeners presented with carefully controlled synthetic tones use attack time, spectral centroid, and spectrum fine structure in dissimilarity rating experiments. These parameters thus appear as major determinants of timbre. However, spectral flux appears as a less salient timbre parameter, its salience depending on the number of other dimensions varying concurrently in the stimulus set. Dissimilarity ratings were analyzed with two different multidimensional scaling models (CLASCAL and CONSCAL), the latter providing psychophysical functions constrained by the physical parameters. Their complementarity is discussed.},

MFA proceeds in two steps: First it computes a PCA of each data table and 'normalizes' each data table by dividing all its elements by the first singular value obtained from its PCA. Second, all the normalized data tables are aggregated into a grand data table that is analyzed via a (non-normalized) PCA that gives a set of factor scores for the observations and loadings for the variables. In addition, MFA provides for each data table a set of partial factor scores for the observations that reflects the specific 'view-point' of this data table. Interestingly, the common factor scores could be obtained by replacing the original normalized data tables by the normalized factor scores obtained from the PCA of each of these tables.

Furthermore, subjects' arousal responses (i.e., exciting vs. relaxing does not replicate the ugly-beautiful dimension and, therefore, adds important new information to overall analysis of emotional response to music. Responses to the exciting-relaxing dimension represent degrees of arousal that suggest one needs to be somewhat aroused in order to have an affective response.

abstract = {Cognitive science has a rich history of interest in the ways that languages represent abstract and concrete concepts (e.g., idea vs. dog). Until recently, this focus has centered largely on aspects of word meaning and semantic representation. However, recent corpora analyses have demonstrated that abstract and concrete words are also marked by phonological, orthographic, and morphological differences. These regularities in sound-meaning correspondence potentially allow listeners to infer certain aspects of semantics directly from word form. We investigated this relationship between form and meaning in a series of four experiments. In Experiments 1-2 we examined the role of metalinguistic knowledge in semantic decision by asking participants to make semantic judgments for aurally presented nonwords selectively varied by specific acoustic and phonetic parameters. Participants consistently associated increased word length and diminished wordlikeness with abstract concepts. In Experiment 3, participants completed a semantic decision task (i.e., abstract or concrete) for real words varied by length and concreteness. Participants were more likely to misclassify longer, inflected words (e.g., "apartment") as abstract and shorter uninflected abstract words (e.g., "fate") as concrete. In Experiment 4, we used a multiple regression to predict trial level naming data from a large corpus of nouns which revealed significant interaction effects between concreteness and word form. Together these results provide converging evidence for the hypothesis that listeners map sound to meaning through a non-arbitrary process using prior knowledge about statistical regularities in the surface forms of words. {\textcopyright} 2012 Reilly et al.},

In general, listeners tended to like music associated with stronger feelings and happy feelings, and to dislike music that evoked sad feelings. Mixed happy and sad feelings were evoked by music with inconsistent cues to happiness and sadness. Listeners who scored high on Agreeableness had more intense emotional responses to music in general, whereas stronger sad feelings were evoked among those who scored high on Agreeableness or Neuroticism. Listeners who liked music that made them feel sad tended to score high on Openness-to-Experience or low on Extraversion, whereas liking for music that evoked mixed feelings was associated positively with music training. The results confirm that liking for music varies as a function of the emotions it evokes and individual differences in personality and music training. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {Eight chocolate milk desserts with different formulation were evaluated by two groups of consumers. Fifty consumers evaluated the samples and indicated their overall liking and answered a CATA question. Meanwhile, 40 consumers elicited up to four words to describe the desserts and completed a projective mapping task. Projective mapping and the check-all-that-apply question provided very similar sensory profiles for the evaluated milk desserts. Differences in the sensory characteristics of the samples were explained by differences in their formulations, which suggest the validity of the sensory profiles given by consumers. Projective mapping and the CATA question consisted on valuable tools to understand their perception of the sensory and hedonic characteristics of the desserts. These methodologies could consist on useful and interesting complimentary techniques to trained assessors' data, being CATA question easier to understand and less time consuming for consumers. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {What is the nature of the feelings evoked by music? We investigated how people represent the subjective experiences associated with Western and Chinese music and the form in which these representational processes are preserved across different cultural groups. US (n = 1,591) and Chinese (n = 1,258) participants listened to 2,168 music samples and reported on the specific feelings (e.g., "angry," "dreamy") or broad affective features (e.g., valence, arousal) that they made individuals feel. Using large-scale statistical tools, we uncovered 13 distinct types of subjective experience associated with music in both cultures. Specific feelings such as "triumphant" were better preserved across the 2 cultures than levels of valence and arousal, contrastingwith theoretical claims that valence and arousal are building blocks of subjective experience. This held true even for music selected on the basis of its valence and arousal levels and for traditional Chinese music. Furthermore, the feelings associated with music were found to occupy continuous gradients, contradicting discrete emotion theories. Our findings, visualized within an interactive map (https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/ ∼acowen/music.HTML) reveal a complex, high-dimensional space of subjective experience associated with music in multiple cultures. These findings can inform inquiries ranging from the etiology of affective disorders to the neurological basis of emotion.},

Spectral analyses of sounds from seven musical instruments (clarinet, flute, oboe, trumpet, violin, harpsichord, and marimba) produced time-varying harmonic amplitude and frequency data. Six basic data simplifications and five combinations of them were applied to the reference tones: amplitude-variation smoothing, coherent variation of amplitudes over time, spectral-envelope smoothing, forced harmonic-frequency variation, frequency-variation smoothing, and harmonic-frequency flattening. Listeners were asked to discriminate sounds resynthesized with simplified data from reference sounds resynthesized with the full data. Averaged over the seven instruments, the discrimination was very good for spectral envelope smoothing and amplitude envelope coherence, but was moderate to poor in decreasing order for forced harmonic frequency variation, frequency variation smoothing, frequency flattening, and amplitude variation smoothing. Discrimination of combinations of simplifications was equivalent to that of the most potent constituent simplification. Objective measurements were made on the spectral data for harmonic amplitude, harmonic frequency, and spectral centroid changes resulting from simplifications. These measures were found to correlate well with discrimination results, indicating that listeners have access to a relatively fine-grained sensory representation of musical instrument sounds.},

abstract = {MODULATION, A SHIFT IN MODE (R ¯AGAM), IS important in South Indian classical (Carn¯atic) music. Here we investigate the sensitivity ofCarn¯atic andWest- ern listeners to such shifts. Carn¯atic music has two kinds of shifts: r¯agam¯alik¯a (retaining tonal center, resembling a shift from C major to C minor in Western music) and grahab¯edham (shifting tonal center, resem- bling a shift from C major to A minor). Listeners heard modulating pieces of music and indicated the point of modulation, and were measured for accuracy and latency. Indians were more accurate than Westerners with both types of modulation but Westerners were faster with grahab¯edhams. Cues could explain perfor- mance differences between nationalities: Indians were more familiar with r¯agam¯alik¯a-type modulations whereas Westerners' culture made them more familiar with grahab¯edham-type modulations. Increased caution toward the less familiar grahab¯edhams for Indians could explain their slower response time compared to r¯agam¯alik¯as. With grahab¯edhams, hit rates for both groups were comparably high, but Westerners' lower level of accuracy was due to higher false-alarm rates to lures that were superficially similar to actual modula- tions. This indicated their dependence on surface-level cues in the absence of familiarity and culture-specific information. Music training helped teachers in both groups make fewer errors when compared to students. Older listeners' performance was comparable to that of younger listeners. Received:},

abstract = {Research indicates that people value music primarily because of the emotions it evokes. Yet, the notion of musical emotions remains controversial, and researchers have so far been unable to offer a satisfactory account of such emotions. We argue that the study of musical emotions has suffered from a neglect of underlying mechanisms. Specifically, researchers have studied musical emotions without regard to how they were evoked, or have assumed that the emotions must be based on the "default" mechanism for emotion induction, a cognitive appraisal. Here, we present a novel theoretical framework featuring six additional mechanisms through which music listening may induce emotions: (1) brain stem reflexes, (2) evaluative conditioning, (3) emotional contagion, (4) visual imagery, (5) episodic memory, and (6) musical expectancy. We propose that these mechanisms differ regarding such characteristics as their information focus, ontogenetic development, key brain regions, cultural impact, induction speed, degree of volitional influence, modularity, and dependence on musical structure. By synthesizing theory and findings from different domains, we are able to provide the first set of hypotheses that can help researchers to distinguish among the mechanisms. We show that failure to control for the underlying mechanism may lead to inconsistent or non-interpretable findings. Thus, we argue that the new framework may guide future research and help to resolve previous disagreements in the field. We conclude that music evokes emotions through mechanisms that are not unique to music, and that the study of musical emotions could benefit the emotion field as a whole by providing novel paradigms for emotion induction. {\textcopyright} 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

The perceived tempo of various sequences (isochronous, irregular, accented, musical) varying in musical tempo was measured by asking twenty nonmusicians and twenty musicians to tap in time with sequences at the rate that they considered most appropriate. (I) Tapping rate varied with sequence tempo (listeners tapped slower with slower sequences), much slower than one tap per sounded event. No difference was observed between regular and irregular sequences, indicating the importance of event density. (2) Tapping rate was slower for accented than unaccented sequences, with tapping at higher hierarchical levels in the structured (accented) sequences. (3) For musical sequences, event density, musical tempo and personal tempo contributed significantly in explaining observed tapping rates. (4) Musicians tapped slower than nonmusicians, suggesting that they are able to perceptually organize events over a longer time span.

abstract = {In the study of music emotions, Valence is usually referred to as one of the dimensions of the circumplex model of emotions that describes music appraisal of happiness, whose scale goes from sad to happy. Nevertheless, re- lated literature shows that Valence is known as being particularly difficult to be predicted by a computational model. As Valence is a contextual music feature, it is assumed here that its prediction should also require contextual music de- scriptors in its predicting model. This work describes the usage of eight contex- tual (also known as higher-level) descriptors, previously developed by us, to calculate happiness in music. Each of these descriptors was independently tested using the correlation coefficient of its prediction with the mean rating of Valence, reckoned by thirty-five listeners, over a piece of music. Following, a linear model using this eight descriptors was created and the result of its predic- tion, for the same piece of music, is described and compared with two other computational models from the literature, designed for the dynamic prediction of music emotion. Finally it is proposed here an initial investigation on the ef- fects of expressive performance and musical structure on the prediction of Valence. Our descriptors are then separated in two groups: performance and structural, where, with each group, we built a linear model. The prediction of Valence given by these two models, over two other pieces of music, are here compared with the correspondent listeners' mean rating of Valence, and the achieved results are depicted, described and discussed.},

The authors tested 487 nonmusic majors in the United States and Japan using taped materials. The stimuli consisted of 30-second representative excerpts of various Western and Eastern music styles. Subjects were asked to describe the character of each excerpt by selecting one of nine adjectival descriptors and to indicate their preference for the excerpt on a 7-point Likert-type scale. Subjects were in greater agreement on the choice of descriptors for Western than for Eastern music, although one group did not exhibit greater consistency than the other in describing music of its own culture. The greatest between-group differences in preference means were for Eastern examples. Responses indicated an overall preference for Western music by both groups, but Japanese subjects were more receptive to Eastern styles than were American subjects. Western examples were generally “liked” by subjects with supplemental musical experience as well as those with limited musical experience. Formal Eastern styles were generally “disliked” by both experience groups. Subjects with greater musical experience, however, generally employed a wider range of music preference responses. {\textcopyright} 1987, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {People sometimes experience a strong emotional response to artworks. Previous studies have demonstrated that the peak emotional experience of chills (goose bumps or shivers) when listening to music involves psychophysiological arousal and a rewarding effect. However, many aspects of peak emotion are still not understood. The current research takes a new perspective of peak emotional response of tears (weeping, lump in the throat). A psychophysiological experiment showed that self-reported chills increased electrodermal activity and subjective arousal whereas tears produced slow respiration during heartbeat acceleration, although both chills and tears induced pleasure and deep breathing. A song that induced chills was perceived as being both happy and sad whereas a song that induced tears was perceived as sad. A tear-eliciting song was perceived as calmer than a chill-eliciting song. These results show that tears involve pleasure from sadness and that they are psychophysiologically calming; thus, psychophysiological responses permit the distinction between chills and tears. Because tears may have a cathartic effect, the functional significance of chills and tears seems to be different. We believe that the distinction of two types of peak emotions is theoretically relevant and further study of tears would contribute to more understanding of human peak emotional response.},

The aim of the present paper is to summarize empirical findings from music cognition research that are relevant to three prominent music theoretic domains: rhythm, melody, and tonality. Attention is paid to how cognitive processes like category formation, stimulus grouping, and expectation can account for the music theoretic key concepts in these domains, such as beat, meter, voice, consonance. We give an overview of computational models that have been proposed in the literature for a variety of music processing tasks related to rhythm, melody, and tonality. Although the present state-of-the-art in computational modeling of music cognition definitely provides valuable resources for testing specific hypotheses and theories, we observe the need for models that integrate the various aspects of music perception and cognition into a single framework. Such models should be able to account for aspects that until now have only rarely been addressed in computational models of music cognition, like the active nature of perception and the development of cognitive capacities from infancy to adulthood. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Permutation tests are a paradox of old and new. Permutation tests pre-date most traditional parametric statistics, but only recently have become part of the mainstream discussion regarding statistical testing. Permutation tests follow a permutation or 'conditional on errors' model whereby a test statistic is computed on the observed data, then (1) the data are permuted over all possible arrangements of the data-an exact permutation test; (2) the data are used to calculate the exact moments of the permutation distribution-a moment approximation permutation test; or (3) the data are permuted over a subset of all possible arrangements of the data-a resampling approximation permutation test. The earliest permutation tests date from the 1920s, but it was not until the advent of modern day computing that permutation tests became a practical alternative to parametric statistical tests. In recent years, permutation analogs of existing statistical tests have been developed. These permutation tests provide noteworthy advantages over their parametric counterparts for small samples and populations, or when distributional assumptions cannot be met. Unique permutation tests have also been developed that allow for the use of Euclidean distance rather than the squared Euclidean distance that is typically employed in parametric tests. This overview provides a chronology of the development of permutation tests accompanied by a discussion of the advances in computing that made permutation tests feasible. Attention is paid to the important differences between 'population models' and 'permutation models', and between tests based on Euclidean and squared Euclidean distances.

A second purpose was to compare musician responses with non-musician responses from a previous study. A repeated-measures design exposed participants to four auditory stimuli of increased complexity. Participants (N = 49) were undergraduate musicians with limited mindfulness experience. Data included absorption in music, mindfulness, and preference and usefulness of auditory stimuli. A repeated-measures analysis of covariance, with absorption of music as a covariate, found no significant differences between stimuli on mindfulness meditation according to musicians. Friedman's analyses of variance indicated that musician rankings of usefulness and preference were significantly different among conditions. Both musicians and non-musicians ranked Melody and Harmony conditions as most preferred and most useful for mindfulness meditation. A mixed effects model with both groups indicated not only a significant effect of auditory stimuli on mindfulness but also interaction due to group status. A significant result was only obtained when the covariate was not considered. Absorption in music scores between groups was significantly higher for musicians than non-musicians. These outcomes support the hypothesis that absorption in music and music expertise may mediate the effect of a music intervention. Clinical implications are discussed.},

abstract = {The present paper reviews a set of studies designed to investigate different aspects of the capacity for processing Western music. This includes perceiving the relationships between a theme and its variations, perceiving musical tensions and relaxations, generating musical expectancies, integrating local structures in large-scale structures, learning new compositional systems and responding to music in an emotional (affective) way. The main focus of these studies was to evaluate the influence of intensive musical training on these capacities. The overall set of data highlights that some musical capacities are acquired through exposure to music without the help of explicit training. These capacities reach such a degree of sophistication that they enable untrained listeners to respond to music as "musically experienced listeners" do. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The proliferation of MP3 players and the exploding amount of digital music content call for novel ways of music organization and retrieval to meet the ever-increasing demand for easy and effective information access. As almost every music piece is created to convey emotion, music organization and retrieval by emotion is a reasonable way of accessing music information. A good deal of effort has been made in the music information retrieval community to train a machine to automatically recognize the emotion of a music signal. A central issue of machine recognition of music emotion is the conceptualization of emotion and the associated emotion taxonomy. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of different ways of emotion annotation, model training, and result visualization. This article provides a comprehensive review of the methods that have been proposed for music emotion recognition. Moreover, as music emotion recognition is still in its infancy, there are many open issues. We review the solutions that have been proposed to address these issues and conclude with suggestions for further research. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM 2157-6904/2012/05-ART40 {\$}10.00.},

While MIR uses a multitude of audio descriptors for tasks such as automatic instrument classification, only a highly constrained set is used to describe the physical correlates of timbre perception in parts of music psychology. We argue that this gap is not coincidental and results from the differences in the two fields' methodologies, their epistemic groundwork, and research goals. This paper lays out perspectives on the emergence of the divide and reviews studies in both fields with regards to divergences in research methods and goals. We discuss new representations for spectro-temporal modulations in MIR and psychology, and compare approaches to spectral envelope description in depth.

Here, we report a crosscultural study with participants from a native African population (Mafa) and Western participants, with both groups being naive to the music of the other respective culture. Experiment 1 investigated the ability to recognize three basic emotions (happy, sad, scared/fearful) expressed in Western music. Results show that the Mafas recognized happy, sad, and scared/fearful Western music excerpts above chance, indicating that the expression of these basic emotions in Western music can be recognized universally. Experiment 2 examined how a spectral manipulation of original, naturalistic music affects the perceived pleasantness of music in Western as well as in Mafa listeners. The spectral manipulation modified, among other factors, the sensory dissonance of the music. The data show that both groups preferred original Western music and also original Mafa music over their spectrally manipulated versions. It is likely that the sensory dissonance produced by the spectral manipulation was at least partly responsible for this effect, suggesting that consonance and permanent sensory dissonance universally influence the perceived pleasantness of music. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate our work, we created a public dataset of 900 audio clips, with subjective annotations following Russell's emotion quadrants. The existent audio features (baseline) and the proposed features (novel) were tested using 20 repetitions of 10-fold cross-validation. Adding the proposed features improved the F1-score to 76.4 percent (by 9 percent), when compared to a similar number of baseline-only features. Moreover, analysing the features relevance and results uncovered interesting relations, namely the weight of specific features and musical concepts to each emotion quadrant, and warrant promising new directions for future research in the field of music emotion recognition, interactive media, and novel music interfaces.},

abstract = {The present study used a temporal bisection task with short ({\textless}2 s) and long ({\textgreater}2 s) stimulus durations to investigate the effect on time estimation of several musical parameters associated with emotional changes in affective valence and arousal. In order to manipulate the positive and negative valence of music, Experiments 1 and 2 contrasted the effect of musical structure with pieces played normally and backwards, which were judged to be pleasant and unpleasant, respectively. This effect of valence was combined with a subjective arousal effect by changing the tempo of the musical pieces (fast vs. slow) (Experiment 1) or their instrumentation (orchestral vs. piano pieces). The musical pieces were indeed judged more arousing with a fast than with a slow tempo and with an orchestral than with a piano timbre. In Experiment 3, affective valence was also tested by contrasting the effect of tonal (pleasant) vs. atonal (unpleasant) versions of the same musical pieces. The results showed that the effect of tempo in music, associated with a subjective arousal effect, was the major factor that produced time distortions with time being judged longer for fast than for slow tempi. When the tempo was held constant, no significant effect of timbre on the time judgment was found although the orchestral music was judged to be more arousing than the piano music. Nevertheless, emotional valence did modulate the tempo effect on time perception, the pleasant music being judged shorter than the unpleasant music. {\textcopyright} 2013 Droit-Volet, Ramos, Bueno and Bigand.},

abstract = {Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods are particularly suited to the analysis of relationships between measures of brain activity and of behavior or experimental design. In neuroimaging, PLS refers to two related methods: (1) symmetric PLS or Partial Least Squares Correlation (PLSC), and (2) asymmetric PLS or Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). The most popular (by far) version of PLS for neuroimaging is PLSC. It exists in several varieties based on the type of data that are related to brain activity: behavior PLSC analyzes the relationship between brain activity and behavioral data, task PLSC analyzes how brain activity relates to pre-defined categories or experimental design, seed PLSC analyzes the pattern of connectivity between brain regions, and multi-block or multi-table PLSC integrates one or more of these varieties in a common analysis. PLSR, in contrast to PLSC, is a predictive technique which, typically, predicts behavior (or design) from brain activity. For both PLS methods, statistical inferences are implemented using cross-validation techniques to identify significant patterns of voxel activation. This paper presents both PLS methods and illustrates them with small numerical examples and typical applications in neuroimaging. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Experiments 1-3 involved "textures" of notes, which were created by repeatedly sounding one of two notes (e.g., C 4 quarter note; D 4 eighth note), so that each note had an equal chance of occurring at any point within a texture. Experiment 1 showed that if a texture change was effected by introducing a pitch or duration that was not in the initial texture, the change was perceived by both attentive and distracted listeners. If a texture change was effected by combining the pitch of one note with the duration of the other note in the initial texture, and vice versa, it was perceived only if the listeners were attentive. Sensitivity to pitch/duration combinations was poorer when the pitch difference between component notes of textures was increased (Experiment 2), but it was better when the difference in duration between component notes was increased (Experiment 3). In Experiment 4, listeners' sensitivity to combinations of pitch pattern and durational pattern in brief sequences was examined. Listeners were sensitive to the manner in which parameter patterns were combined when they were attentive, but not when they were distracted. The results are discussed in view of featureintegration theory and its application to music cognition. {\textcopyright} 1994 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract = {In this introduction to a selection of case studies on the theme "the past in music" I offer a few thoughts on the nature of the past and the role of memory in constructing historical narrative, with reference to the way in which these concepts have been theorized by historians, archaeologists, anthropologists and ethnomusicologists. In reviewing the different ways in which echoes of the past can still be heard in the music of the present, I consider the capacity of music to evoke, embody and transform the past and, by so doing, to act as a medium for history and its interpretation. "Typically", to quote Nettl, "ethnomusicology studies the musical culture of a society through the observation of the present" (1983, 176). It is this observation, in the guise of fieldwork, which most clearly distinguishes ethnomusicology from historical musicology with its primary interest in musical works created in the past. Yet this does not mean that the past remains forever outside the ethnomusicologist's frame.1 "Any picture of the present that is not informed by an appreciation of the historical dimension is," as Widdess notes, "sadly incomplete" (1992, 219). On the surface, fieldwork most often involves direct engagement with the present via observation of contemporary action and interaction with living subjects. Much of what is revealed to us, however, relates as much to the past as to the present. Fieldwork opens doors into the past through memory and narrative, and also through a revisiting of the spaces in which the past and its music lived (see Bohlman 1997). Bohlman has proposed that O Routledge e{\^{}}k Taylor {\&} Francis Croup Caroline Bithell (PhD Wales) is Lecturer in Ethnomusicology at the University of Manchester, UK. Drawing on her research into Corsican music, she has published a number of journal articles and book chapters spanning a range of thematic and theoretical areas, including oral traditions of vocal polyphony, the revival and reconstruction of traditional repertoires, the commercialization and professionalization of traditional music, music and gender, music and nationalism, and the politics of fieldwork and ethnography.},

Perceptual studies have revealed a number of verbal attributes that reliably map onto timbral qualities, but the conventions of timbre description in spoken and written discourse remain poorly understood. Books on orchestration provide a valuable source of natural language about instrumental timbre. This article uses methods from corpus linguistics to explore the semantic features of timbre through a quantitative analysis of 11 orchestration treatises and manuals. Findings reveal a relatively constrained vocabulary for timbre: about 50 adjectives account for half of all descriptions in the corpus. The timbre lexicon can be categorized according to affect, matter, metaphor, mimesis, action, acoustics, and onomatopoeia, and further reduced to three latent conceptual dimensions, which are labeled and discussed. Descriptive patterns vary systematically by instrument and instrument family, suggesting certain regularities and consistencies to timbre description in the orchestral tradition. This study helps test the long-held assumption that conventions of timbre description are vague and unsystematic, and offers a cognitive linguistic account of the timbre-language connection.},

We also provide a critique of this research, noting that previous studies have tended to neglect the social context of music listening. The most likely reason for this neglect, we argue, is that that most research on musical emotion has, implicitly or explicitly, taken the perspective of the musician in understanding responses to music. In contrast, we argue that a promising avenue toward a better understanding of emotional responses to music involves diary and questionnaire studies of how ordinary listeners actually use music in everyday life contexts. Accordingly, we present findings from an exploratory questionnaire study featuring 141 music listeners (between 17 and 74 years of age) that offers some novel insights. The results provide preliminary estimates of the occurrence of various emotions in listening to music, as well as clues to how music is used by listeners in a number of different emotional ways in various life contexts. These results confirm that emotion is strongly related to most people's primary motives for listening to music. {\textcopyright} 2004, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Emotions are centered in subjective experiences that people represent, in part, with hundreds, if not thousands, of semantic terms. Claims about the distribution of reported emotional states and the boundaries between emotion categories—that is, the geometric organization of the semantic space of emotion—have sparked intense debate. Here we introduce a conceptual framework to analyze reported emotional states elicited by 2,185 short videos, examining the richest array of reported emotional experiences studied to date and the extent to which reported experiences of emotion are structured by discrete and dimensional geometries. Across self-report methods, we find that the videos reliably elicit 27 distinct varieties of reported emotional experience. Further analyses revealed that categorical labels such as amusement better capture reports of subjective experience than commonly measured affective dimensions (e.g., valence and arousal). Although reported emotional experiences are represented within a semantic space best captured by categorical labels, the boundaries between categories of emotion are fuzzy rather than discrete. By analyzing the distribution of reported emotional states we uncover gradients of emotion—from anxiety to fear to horror to disgust, calmness to aesthetic appreciation to awe, and others—that correspond to smooth variation in affective dimensions such as valence and dominance. Reported emotional states occupy a complex, high-dimensional categorical space. In addition, our library of videos and an interactive map of the emotional states they elicit (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/emogifs/map.html) are made available to advance the science of emotion.},

abstract = {This article provides an introduction to the bootstrap. The bootstrap provides statistical inferences-standard error and bias estimates, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests-without assumptions such as Normal distributions or equal variances. As such, bootstrap methods can be remarkably more accurate than classical inferences based on Normal or t distributions. The bootstrap uses the same basic procedure regardless of the statistic being calculated, without requiring the use of application-specific formulae. This article may provide two big surprises for many readers. The first is that the bootstrap shows that common t confidence intervals are woefully inaccurate when populations are skewed, with one-sided coverage levels off by factors of two or more, even for very large samples. The second is that the number of bootstrap samples required is much larger than generally realized.

abstract = {A musical interpretation is often the result of a wide range of requirements on expressiveness rendering and technical skills. Aspects that are indicated with the term expressive intention and which refers to the communication of moods and feelings are being considered more and more important in performer-computer interaction during music performance. Recent studies demonstrated that by modifying opportunely systematic deviations introduced by the musician it is possible to convey different sensitive content like expressive intentions and emotions. We present an abstract space, that can be used for the user interface, which represents, at an abstract level, the expressive content and the interaction between the performer and the expressive engine. This space was derived by multidimensional analysis of perceptual tests on various professionally performed pieces ranging from western classical to popular music. This space reflects how the musical performances are organized in the listener's mind.},

abstract = {Musically trained and untrained listeners were required to listen to 27 musical excerpts and to group those that conveyed a similar emotional meaning (Experiment 1). The groupings were transformed into a matrix of emotional dissimilarity that was analysed through multidimensional scaling methods (MDS). A 3-dimensional space was found to provide a good fit of the data, with arousal and emotional valence as the primary dimensions. Experiments 2 and 3 confirmed the consistency of this 3-dimensional space using excerpts of only 1 second duration. The overall findings indicate that emotional responses to music are very stable within and between participants, and are weakly influenced by musical expertise and excerpt duration. These findings are discussed in light of a cognitive account of musical emotion. {\textcopyright} 2005 Psychology Press Ltd.},

abstract = {We explored the content and structure of the cognitive, knowledge-based concept underlying aesthetic responses to music. To this aim, we asked 290 Finnish students to verbally associate the aesthetic value of music and to write down a list of appropriate adjectives within a given time limit. No music was presented during the task. In addition, information about participants' musical background was collected. A variety of analysis techniques was used to determine the key results of our study. The adjective "beautiful" proved to be the core item of the concept under question. Interestingly, the adjective "touching" was often listed together with "beautiful". In addition, we found music-specific vocabulary as well as adjectives related to emotions and mood states indicating that affective processes are an essential part of aesthetic responses to music. Differences between music experts and laymen as well as between female and male participants were found for a number of adjectives. These findings suggest the existence of a common conceptual space underlying aesthetic responses to music, which partly can be modified by the level of musical expertise and gender. {\textcopyright} 2009 by ESCOM European Society for the Cognitive Sciences of Music.},

abstract = {If the structure of language vocabularies mirrors the structure of natural divisions that are universally perceived, then the meanings of words in different languages should closely align. By contrast, if shared word meanings are a product of shared culture, history and geography, they may differ between languages in substantial but predictable ways. Here, we analysed the semantic neighbourhoods of 1,010 meanings in 41 languages. The most-aligned words were from semantic domains with high internal structure (number, quantity and kinship). Words denoting natural kinds, common actions and artefacts aligned much less well. Languages that are more geographically proximate, more historically related and/or spoken by more-similar cultures had more aligned word meanings. These results provide evidence that the meanings of common words vary in ways that reflect the culture, history and geography of their users.},

@article{Watt1998,
abstract = {Music has a strong effect on people's mental state and behaviour. This effect can be at a simple motor level, or it can be at a more complex level of arbitrary association or it can be at a much more complex cognitive and representational level. This latter case is of specific interest because it implies that, to some degree, music can be said to have a content that is not musical. Thus, when music is taken to depict a rough sea, then something in the music causes that: the music contains something that is being taken to signify roughness-of-sea. The existence of a large, natural yet arbitrary vocabulary (as is demonstrably the case for language) to relate musical expressions to non-musical events/objects seems implausible. In this paper, the possibility is explored that the vocabulary of musical expression concerns psychological aspects of people. Thus music, it is hypothesised, can express male/female-ness and good/evil-ness and happy/sad-ness and so on. Data obtained in a novel paradigm designed to test this hypothesis are described. Substantial support for the hypothesis is found: the implications of this are discussed.},

@article{Papiotis2014,
abstract = {In a musical ensemble such as a string quartet, the musicians interact and influence each other's actions in several aspects of the performance simultaneously in order to achieve a common aesthetic goal. In this article, we present and evaluate a computational approach for measuring the degree to which these interactions exist in a given performance. We recorded a number of string quartet exercises under two experimental conditions (solo and ensemble), acquiring both audio and bowing motion data. Numerical features in the form of time series were extracted from the data as performance descriptors representative of four distinct dimensions of the performance: Intonation, Dynamics, Timbre and Tempo. Four different interdependence estimation methods (two linear and two nonlinear) were applied to the extracted features in order to assess the overall level of interdependence between the four musicians. The obtained results suggest that it is possible to correctly discriminate between the two experimental conditions by quantifying interdependence between the musicians in each of the studied performance dimensions; the nonlinear methods appear to perform best for most of the numerical features tested. Moreover, by using the solo recordings as a reference to which the ensemble recordings are contrasted, it is feasible to compare the amount of interdependence that is established between the musicians in a given performance dimension across all exercises, and relate the results to the underlying goal of the exercise. We discuss our findings in the context of ensemble performance research, the current limitations of our approach, and the ways in which it can be expanded and consolidated. {\textcopyright} 2014 Papiotis, Marchini, Perez-carrillo and Maestre.},
